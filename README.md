# Richfaces - tweaked version

This version has no updates over the primary branch. It is only made to be buildable under JDK-11 and targeting Java-8.

I also removed the dependency on the cdk code generator as I'm not planning to change any of the sources anyway. So no use in constantly generating the code with an incompatible plugin.

- Set your JDK to version 11
- `mvn clean install`
